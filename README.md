# breast-cancer-prediction

To explore the Breast Cancer dataset and develop a Logistic Regression model to try classifying suspected cells to Benign or Malignant. 

Logistic Regression was used in the biological sciences in early twentieth century. It was then used in many social science applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

For example,

To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)
Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.
